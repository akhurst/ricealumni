                                      Our first trip of 2009 is our most ambitious 
                                      ever &#8212; a 24-day journey to the most 
                                      treasured and legendary places on earth. 
                                      We will travel in the comfort of a private 
                                      Boeing 757 configured to accommodate only 
                                      88 passengers. Direct flights to each destination 
                                      will ensure that we have more time to experience

                                      The first stops on our extraordinary journey 
                                      are Peru&#8217;s ancient Incan citadel, 
                                      Machu Picchu, and the city of Cusco, where 
                                      Incan and Spanish cultures intertwine. Then 
                                      we will travel to Easter Island, the most 
                                      remote inhabited island in the world, to 
                                      marvel at its enormous moai statues, followed 
                                      by Samoa, the cradle of Polynesian culture; 
                                      Australia&#8217;s Great Barrier Reef; and 
                                      the astoundingly beautiful Angkor Wat temple 
                                      complex in Cambodia. The second half of 
                                      our expedition includes visits to the majestic 
                                      Portola Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, the rooftop 
                                      of the world; the legendary Taj Mahal at 
                                      Agra, India; the Serengeti National Park 
                                      in Tanzania for a safari adventure; and 
                                      Luxor and the pyramids in Egypt. The final 
                                      stop of our trip is Fez, Morocco, the most 
                                      complete medieval Islamic city in the world.

                                    Charles Darwin described the majority of the 
                                    plant and animal life on the Galapagos Islands 
                                    as &quot;being found nowhere else.&quot; There 
                                    are 19 islands in this remote volcanic archipelago, 
                                    and each is overflowing with life within its 
                                    own ecosystem. Because there are few natural 
                                    predators, the abundant wildlife is nearly 
                                    fearless and accepts close contact with human 
                                    company. You can walk among 400-pound tortoises 
                                    and through a giant prickly pear cactus forest, 
                                    search for pink flamingos, observe large colonies 
                                    of charming blue-footed boobies and snorkel 
                                    alongside tropical penguins. It is a dream 
                                    destination for nature lovers.<br>

                                    Our trip will begin with a flight to Quito, 
                                    Ecuador, for a three-night stay, which will 
                                    provide our group with an opportunity to explore 
                                    this city, known for its magnificent Spanish 
                                    colonial architecture, quaint family-owned 
                                    shops and lively open-air markets. On day 
                                    four, you will arrive on the small island 
                                    of Baltra, where you will embark the 88-passenger

                                    During the next five days, zodiacs will take 
                                    you ashore at Santa Cruz, Bartolom&eacute;, 
                                    Santiago, Rabida and North Seymour so that

                                    Tuscany is a perennial favorite destination. 
                                    In 2008, we will explore Tuscany from our 
                                    home base in the beautiful medieval city of 
                                    Sienna. Our itinerary features three UNESCO 
                                    World Heritage Sites and offers a perfect 
                                    balance between the world-renowned artistic 
                                    treasures of Florence and the less visited 
                                    medieval towns and villages of the Tuscan 
                                    countryside.<br>
                                    <br>
                            A full program of educational and cultural enrichment is incorporated in this itinerary, including a series of lectures about Tuscan history and culture, focusing on Tuscany as a center of the Italian Renaissance and efforts to preserve the region's artistic and architectural heritage. In addition to exploring Sienna, excursions include a full day in Florence featuring a visit to the famous Galleria dell'Accademia to see Michaelangelo's &quot;David;&quot; the picturesque medieval hamlet of Montalcino and a visit to the Abbey of St. Antimo, where local monks will perform Gregorian chants; a tour of enchanting San Gimignano, known as the &quot;City of Beautiful Towers;&quot; and an in-depth tour of the world-renowned wine-producing region of Chianti, featuring a visit to the 15th century village of Radda and a specially arranged wine tasting.<br>

                                    Our itinerary is a combination of visits to China's modern cities and its legendary archaeological sites. It begins with four nights in Beijing, where we will visit traditional sites like the Great Wall and the Forbidden City and view the innovative architecture for the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. The Silk Road cities of Urumqi, Kashgar, Turpan, Gaochang and Dunhuang are less known to most travelers, but you will discover each one has its own special importance. Our itinerary will conclude with visits to Xian and its Terra-Cotta Warriors and Shanghai, China's most European-influenced city.<br>
