                        <p><em>Below is the text of a letter sent to alumni and students who wrote   President Leebron expressing opposition to the sale of the KTRU tower   and broadcasting license:</em><br>
                          <br>
I am writing in response to your letter   regarding KTRU.&nbsp; First, thank you very much for taking the time to   communicate your views.&nbsp; Obviously, KTRU does hold a strong place in the   hearts of both those who worked at the station and those who listen to   it.<br>
<br>
I have received many emails and letters, many strongly   supportive of the university&rsquo;s decision, but the majority raising   objections.&nbsp; I would have hoped to respond individually to each email   and letter I have received, but I didn&rsquo;t want too much time to pass   before getting back to you.&nbsp; So I ask you to forgive this general   response, which tries to address the points raised most frequently in   the various communications I have received.<br>
<br>
First, it bears   reiterating that we are not selling KTRU.&nbsp; We are selling the 50,000   watt broadcast license and radio tower.&nbsp; This is not a trivial   distinction.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t claim of course that KTRU will reach the same   audience, although the ability to reach audiences through the Web and in   more places is growing rapidly.&nbsp; Some who wrote in objecting to the   sale of the tower and license live well beyond its broadcast range.&nbsp;   They must understand that their access to KTRU will remain unchanged.&nbsp;   The critical question that must be asked is in what ways the student   experience will be changed as a result of this decision.&nbsp; Students will   still manage the station (along with its general manager Will Robedee),   design its programs and serve as DJs and announcers.&nbsp; They may reach   somewhat fewer people, but their audience will be increasingly global,   and their opportunities for experience not significantly diminished.&nbsp;   The question is not whether providing the KTRU experience is worth   almost $10 million, but rather whether the difference between a   Web-based-only format and the 50,000 watts justifies allocating all of   those resources solely to KTRU.&nbsp; In addition, we had to take into   account that a radio broadcast license was most likely a declining asset   over the long term as a result of changes in technology and consumer   preferences for accessing music. </p></td>

                        Second, I do want to address   the issue of confidentiality and the lack of discussion or consultation   regarding this sale.&nbsp; This is indeed a serious objection.&nbsp; We have tried   since my arrival to have open discussion of both fundamental issues   regarding the future of Rice and all important issues that affect   students.&nbsp; These have included every aspect of the Call to Conversation,   and especially the expansion of the student body.&nbsp; This openness was   the policy we followed in our discussions about a possible merger with   Baylor College of Medicine.&nbsp; Input from students was critical in   determining the size, location and design of our two new colleges and   the renovation project in the south colleges.&nbsp; This is certainly our   preferred mode of making decisions, and the standard against which we   should be judged. &nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        The special circumstances of conducting a   bidding process for a broadcast license and negotiating the terms of the   transaction required confidentiality.&nbsp; We sought advice about the best   ways to conduct this process from those with deep experience in the sale   of university-owned broadcast licenses.&nbsp; They advised that we needed to   have a confidential process.&nbsp; This troubled many of us, and we asked   ourselves throughout the process whether we could bring students and   others into it, but concluded that this would not be compatible with the   negotiations we were undertaking and our ability to bring them to a   timely conclusion. &nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        Going forward, students and others are   entitled to hold us to our word that this is not a precedent.&nbsp; We   believe that the confidential process we undertook was a necessity in   these very specific and unusual circumstances.&nbsp; We believe equally that   this must be a very rare exception to our commitment to involving   students in the decisions which affect student life.&nbsp; Indeed, we have   certainly taken note of the very strong feelings expressed on this   issue, and thus might in the future strike a different balance between   confidentiality and consultation even when the needs for confidentiality   are high.<br>
                        <br>
                        Third, I want to reiterate and perhaps amplify what we   have said about the use of the proceeds.&nbsp; A portion will be used to   help fund the construction of the new servery for Will Rice, Lovett and   eventually Sid Rich.&nbsp; This has been a high priority for our students,   communicated with passion and frequency over the years. (This is not, as   some have assumed, part of the expansion of the student body, but   rather part of our plan to improve the quality of our older colleges.)&nbsp;   It will enable us to markedly improve food quality and variety.&nbsp; The   majority of the resources will be applied in ways strongly informed by   student input.&nbsp; We expect this will include first and foremost support   for KTRU as Web-based radio so that our students can operate a station   on the cutting edge of technology.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also expect that some of the   resources will be used to expand media opportunities for our students   more broadly, bringing to more students a more diverse array of choices   in this arena.&nbsp; Other uses, such as lighting an additional playing   field, have also been mentioned repeatedly by the students as one of   their top priorities, but no decisions have been made, nor will they be   made without substantial student input.&nbsp; It is not irrelevant in this   context that the students have voted down KTRU blanket tax increases.&nbsp;   These votes have indeed indicated the need to expand our resources for   student opportunities in other areas.<br>
                        <br>
                        I do want to acknowledge   not only the passion of KTRU supporters, but also the important role   that KTRU leaders and others have played over the years in creating an   important opportunity for our students and providing an eclectic mix of   programming for our community.&nbsp; You have built something important for   our university that will continue in a different form.&nbsp; While no doubt   most involved directly with KTRU are opposed to the decision we made, we   have received expressions of support from some others who were involved   with the founding of KTRU for making this decision at this time and   focusing on newer technologies while realizing value more broadly for   our students.<br>
                        <br>
                        Universities are entering a new time, during which   we will have to reallocate resources as well as raise resources to   achieve our priorities.&nbsp; No one likes to see their favorite activity or   program cut.&nbsp; But we will have to make choices and aim to make sure that   all resources, including potential sources of revenue, are applied in   ways to maximize our students&rsquo; experience at Rice, as well as the   excellence of our faculty.&nbsp;&nbsp; These choices are never easy.&nbsp; Almost any   choice about reducing or cutting programs will result in some outcry.&nbsp;   This decision was made by the administration and the Board of Trustees.&nbsp;   The latter consists of 24 members, most of whom are incredibly   dedicated alumni.<br>
                        <br>
                        Last, I want to address those of you who said   you would likely withhold future contributions.&nbsp; We regard each and   every contribution as a wonderful act of generosity, and those from   alumni as expressions of their love and gratitude for their Rice   experience.&nbsp; You are of course entitled to decide not to provide that   support to Rice, and I cannot object to the choice you make.&nbsp; But   frankly, if all our graduates took the view that if the university makes   a decision with which they strongly disagree they will not contribute,   we would not receive any donations at all, and we would be a much weaker   university and able to offer much less to our students.&nbsp; Some of our   most generous donors have been people who over time have very strongly   disagreed with decisions the university has taken.&nbsp; But they have   understood both that their desire to make our university ever stronger,   and stronger forever, as well as their desire to return some of the   benefits they feel they have received, argue persuasively for their   continued support.&nbsp; We cannot eschew all change, and all hard decisions,   simply because some of our graduates feel so strongly that they   threaten to, and perhaps ultimately do, withhold support.&nbsp; It will be a   loss, and not only to our current and future students, but in fact to   our alumni as well.&nbsp; We urge you to continue to make your views known to   us.&nbsp; The passion of Rice students and graduates is one of our great   strengths.&nbsp; But so too is the fact that the vast majority of our   graduates choose to support the university even when they take issue   with particular decisions or directions.<br>
                        <br>
                        I have spent much of the   time over the last week with our new students and their upper class   advisers.&nbsp; They are a remarkable group and wonderfully happy.&nbsp; They are   encountering the true essence of the Rice experience, which for some is   symbolized in part by the fact that within their first week they have   had a barbecue dinner at the president&rsquo;s house, dragged me into dancing   with them, and perhaps come by the house as part of their O-Week   scavenger hunt.&nbsp; I cherish these opportunities to get to know our   students.&nbsp; We are in fact a wondrous caring community, but a community   nonetheless that will have to make decisions that are controversial.&nbsp; We   should not question in that context each other&rsquo;s loyalty and commitment   to Rice.&nbsp; Our university has gone through continuous and substantial   change since its founding.&nbsp; If you loved the university in 1970 or 1980   or 2000 or 2010, you loved a university that got to be there only by   changing over time, and especially when times were difficult, making the   hard decisions that would carry it forward.<br>
                        <br>
                        I acknowledge,   understand and appreciate the depth of passion for KTRU.&nbsp; You will have   to judge over time whether we have continued to secure and create new   innovative media opportunities that serve today&rsquo;s and tomorrow&rsquo;s   students.&nbsp; Working together, and through our disagreements, there is   little we can&rsquo;t ultimately achieve.<br>
                        <br>
                        Again, thank you for taking the time to communicate your views, and for your strong commitment to the Rice experience.<br>
                        <br>
