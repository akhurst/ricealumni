With the change, the Alumni Trustees were granted voting privileges. The terms of these Alumni Trustees are to run four years beginning July 1 following their selection and approval by the Board and the Board of Trustees. </p>

                                                <p> (e) No alumnus or alumna of Rice University who receives a salary or other compensation from Rice University as a full- or part-time employee or otherwise shall be eligible for nomination or election as an Alumni Trustee. </p>
                        <p> Section 4. <em>Vacancy</em> &ndash; Upon the death or resignation of an Alumni Trustee the vacancy shall be filled by the same nominating procedure as is used to fill the annual vacancy. The persons nominated for the vacancy shall satisfy the same geographic considerations as their predecessor at the time of his or her predecessor's election. The term of office of members so elected shall begin on the date of their election and shall extend through the unexpired term of the predecessor. </p>
                        <p> Section 5. <em>Approval</em> &ndash; The Committee on Alumni Trustee Nominations will submit the names certified by its chair to the Board for acceptance or rejection. Upon receipt of the nominees' names, the Board will vote on the recommendations at its next meeting. </p>
                        <p> Section 6. <em>Submission to Board of Trustees</em> &ndash; Upon approval by the Board, the names of the candidate for Alumni Trustee and the three ranked alternates will be certified to the Board of Trustees by the President and Executive Director in accordance with the nominations process of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees will then approve the candidate or, if that candidate is not approved or declines the nomination, will select a candidate from the ranked list of three alternates and thereafter will notify the Board of its action. </p>
                        <p>Section 7. <em>Board of Trustee Responsibilities</em> &ndash; The duties and responsibilities of the Alumni Trustees shall be set by the Board of Trustees of Rice University. </p>
