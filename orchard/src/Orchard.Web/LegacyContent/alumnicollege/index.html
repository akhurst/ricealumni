<h3>DNA:  Past, Present, and Future </h3>
<h4>with Dr. Kathleen Matthews</h4>

<p>From the time that DNA was identified as the genetic material in the mid-1940’s, this “molecule of life” has been studied with intense interest.  Over the ensuing decades, the 3-dimensional structure of DNA and the modes by which information encoded in DNA sequence is expressed have been elucidated.  The development of methods to sequence, synthesize, and manipulate DNA segments has opened previously unimagined avenues.  High-throughput sequencing allows us not only to explore genetic linkages to disease but also to understand our relationship to other living organisms.  These methods allow detection and dissection of the multiplicity of species — particularly bacteria ¬— that inhabit not only our environment but also our selves.</p> 

<h3>How Rice Is Preparing Its Students to Be Job Makers, Not Job Takers </h3>
<h4>with Bryan Guido Hassin</h4>

<p>Entrepreneurship is a hot topic today but most of what the media portrays about it is provably wrong. This interactive session will use cutting edge research to bust myths about entrepreneurship, explore what really works, and present what Rice is doing to empower students and faculty with the tools they need to commercialize amazing ideas and research. </p> 

<h3>Poetry in the 21st Century</h3>
<h4>with Dr. Joseph Campana</h4>

<p>Flarf, twitter, documentary, erasure: are these the faces of poetry in the 21st century? Is poetry now a brave new world or a case of the more things change the more they stay the same? This course examines a number of trends and tendencies in poetics in the last decade or so to see how writers and critics understand poetry. We’ll think particularly about poetry’s relationship to literary traditions, media transformations, and forms of experimentation that link poetry to its sister arts (painting, opera, etc.). Time willing, the course will be part lecture, part discussion, and part writing workshop.</p> 

<h3>Rice University from Lovett to Leebron </h3>
<h4>with Dr. John Boles</h4>

<p>This class will sweep across the entire arc of Rice’s history, from its chartering by William M. Rice in 1891 and the formative role played by the first president, Edgar Odell Lovett, to the challenges offered by two world wars and the great depression, and then to the emergence of the modern Rice under the leadership of Presidents Houston, Pitzer, Hackerman, Rupp, Gillis, and Leebron. We will emphasize how the university has evolved, grown in size and variety of programs, developed its campus, become more diverse and international, and yet amid all the change stayed undeniably “Rice,” with its basic character both distinct and unchanging. </p> 




<h3>Rice’s Activity in Open and Online Education</h3>
<h4>with Dr. Sidney Burrus</h4>

<p>Open Education.  One perfect storm yields four revolutions:  Textbooks and classroom lectures, both longtime staples of higher education, are alike in two key respects: Each was innovative more than a century ago, and each will be phased out this century as educators scramble to address the daunting challenges of lowering costs, increasing access, improving quality, and increasing personalization. The confluence of internet distribution of content, the web’s allowing interaction, new open copyright licenses, new graphical interfaces, new cognitive science based pedagogy, and machine-learning based adaptivity has created a “perfect storm” in all of education.  This lecture will look at these factors and give an overview of some of the cutting-edge work being done at Rice to exploit these new tools and address our world’s educational problems in K-12, higher ed, and continuing education.</p> 

<h3>Achievement Gaps in Houston and the Nation </h3>
<h4>with Dr. Ruth Lopez Turley</h4>

<p>This class explores the achievement gaps between poor and non-poor K-12 students as well as between White and Black/Hispanic students in Houston and the nation.  Although the gaps have narrowed somewhat since the early 1970s, they remain large and significant and have serious implications for our future workforce.  Using new longitudinal data, we will discuss patterns over time and across grade levels, as well as the relative importance of race versus economic status and, most importantly, current efforts to close these gaps.  </p>

<h3>Engaging with Rice Students as a Career Mentor </h3>
<h4>with Nicole Van Den Heuvel and Dr. Michael Maher</h4>

<p>Looking back on your career path, can you think of one individual who provided invaluable guidance and mentorship to you on your career journey?  You can probably think of someone whose mentorship impacted your career in a significant way.  This lecture will explore how to become an effective mentor to Rice students through the newly launched Rice OWL Mentor Network on LinkedIn.  The speakers will demonstrate how to create a LinkedIn profile, join the group, become an impactful mentor for our Rice students, and the personal benefits gained for participating in the Rice OWL Mentor Network.</p> 

<h2>1:45pm-3:15pm</h2>

<h3>Chemistry & Biomolecular Engineering</h3>
<h4>with Dr. Vicki Colvin</h4>

<p>COURSE DESCRIPTION COMING SOON!</p> 

<h3>Central Asian Conquest Empire</h3>
<h4>with Dr. Lisa Balabanlilar</h4>

<p>At the beginning of the thirteenth century the nomadic Turco-Mongol tribes of Central Asia were united under the leadership of Chingis Khan (Genghis Khan/Oceanic Ruler).  Within just a few decades, the populations of Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East were forcibly absorbed as subject peoples into the Mongol steppe-based kingdom, which would grow to become the largest contiguous empire in world history.  This is an examination of cultural and political traditions among the Turco-Mongols  that gave them the technologies and vision they would use to create a world empire.</p> 

<h3>Two Movie Versions of 'Romeo and Juliet'</h3>
<h4>with Dr. Dennis Huston</h4>

<p>In this class Professor Huston will show cuts from, and discuss, two very different – but both brilliant – versions of &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot;   The first of these films, made by Franco Zeffirelli, was produced in 1968, the second, by Baz Luhrmann, made in 1996.  The first of these films is a very powerful rendition of the play, starring Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, who were only 15 and 17 when the movie was made.   But Zeffirelli made sure his two young stars could play the Shakespearean language in a natural and powerful way – to great effect.   The acting and the cinematography are both brilliant and make the film unforgettable.  Luhrmann's version of the play used a modern setting, gorgeous actors, and striking cinematic images to make his film the most successful Shakespeare movie ever made.  These two films couldn't be more different, and yet they are both brilliantly imaginative constructs.</p> 

<h3>Active Learning, Digital Learning, and the Evolving Rice Experience</h3>
<h4>with Dr. John Hutchinson</h4>

<p>Recent studies at Rice and elsewhere demonstrate conclusively that our students learn most effectively when they are actively engaged in the learning process.  As such, a wide variety of approaches have been introduced to transform the classroom experiences of our students from passive listening to active or problem-based learning.  These new methods have been introduced at the same time that Rice has begun experimenting with digital learning and the "massively open on-line course" concept.  These two contrasting approaches to education raise fascinating questions about the optimal experiences we can give our students which combine these two exciting developments.  I will discuss active learning, constructive learning, digital learning, and the possible transformation of the Rice undergraduate experience.</p> 

<h3>The Changing Face of Houston and America: Tracking the Economic and Demographic Transformations through 31 Years of Houston Surveys</h3>
<h4>with Dr. Stephen Klineberg</h4>

<p>The Houston region recovered from the collapse of the oil-boom in the 1980s to find itself in the midst of a restructured, knowledge-based, fully global economy and a truly remarkable demographic revolution. These are the trends that are refashioning the social and political landscape across all of urban America. We review the findings from more than three decades of systematic survey research to explore the way the transformations are unfolding both in Houston and across America, and to consider their implications for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>

We review the findings from more than three decades of systematic survey research to explore the way the transformations are unfolding both in Houston and across America, and to consider their implications for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
