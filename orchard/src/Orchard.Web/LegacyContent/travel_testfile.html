//** Accordion Content script: By Dynamic Drive, at http://www.dynamicdrive.com
//** Created: Jan 7th, 08'

//Version 1.3: April 3rd, 08':
//**1) Script now no longer conflicts with other JS frameworks
//**2) Adds custom oninit() and onopenclose() event handlers that fire when Accordion Content instance has initialized, plus whenever a header is opened/closed
//**3) Adds support for expanding header(s) using the URL parameter (ie: http://mysite.com/accordion.htm?headerclass=0,1)

//April 9th, 08': Fixed "defaultexpanded" setting not working when page first loads

//Version 1.4: June 4th, 08':
//**1) Added option to activate a header "mouseover" instead of the default "click"
//**2) Bug persistence not working when used with jquery 1.2.6

//Version 1.5: June 20th, 08':
//**1) Adds new "onemustopen:true/false" parameter, which lets you set whether at least one header should be open at all times (so never all closed).
//**2) Changed cookie path to site wide for persistence feature
//**3) Fixed bug so "expandedindices" parameter in oninit(headers, expandedindices) returns empty array [] instead of [-1] when no expanded headers found

//**1) Version 1.5.1: June 27th, 08': Fixed "defaultexpanded" setting not working properly when used with jquery 1.2.6

//Version 1.6: Oct 3rd, 08':
//**1) Adds new "mouseoverdelay" param that sets delay before headers are activated when "revealtype" param is set to "mouseover"
//**2) Fixed bug with "onemustopen" param not working properly when "revealtype" is set to "click"

//Version 1.7: March 24th, 09': Adds a 3rd revealtype setting "clickgo", which causes browser to navigate to URL specified inside the header after expanding its contents.

//Version 1.7.1: May 28th, 09': Fixed issue that causes margins/paddings in accordion DIVs to be lost in IE8

Our first trip of 2009 is our most ambitious 
                                      ever &#8212; a 24-day journey to the most 
                                      treasured and legendary places on earth. 
                                      We will travel in the comfort of a private 
                                      Boeing 757 configured to accommodate only 
                                      88 passengers. Direct flights to each destination 
                                      will ensure that we have more time to experience 
                                      the locales.<br>
                                      <br>
The first stops on our extraordinary journey 
                                      are Peru&#8217;s ancient Incan citadel, 
                                      Machu Picchu, and the city of Cusco, where 
                                      Incan and Spanish cultures intertwine. Then 
                                      we will travel to Easter Island, the most 
                                      remote inhabited island in the world, to 
                                      marvel at its enormous moai statues, followed 
                                      by Samoa, the cradle of Polynesian culture; 
                                      Australia&#8217;s Great Barrier Reef; and 
                                      the astoundingly beautiful Angkor Wat temple 
                                      complex in Cambodia. The second half of 
                                      our expedition includes visits to the majestic 
                                      Portola Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, the rooftop 
                                      of the world; the legendary Taj Mahal at 
                                      Agra, India; the Serengeti National Park 
                                      in Tanzania for a safari adventure; and 
                                      Luxor and the pyramids in Egypt. The final 
                                      stop of our trip is Fez, Morocco, the most 
                                      complete medieval Islamic city in the world. 
                                      At each destination, travelers form smaller 
                                      groups for intimate, in-depth exploration 
                                      and have choices for alternative sightseeing 
                                      excursions.<br>

Charles Darwin described the majority of the 
                                    plant and animal life on the Galapagos Islands 
                                    as &quot;being found nowhere else.&quot; There 
                                    are 19 islands in this remote volcanic archipelago, 
                                    and each is overflowing with life within its 
                                    own ecosystem. Because there are few natural 
                                    predators, the abundant wildlife is nearly 
                                    fearless and accepts close contact with human 
                                    company. You can walk among 400-pound tortoises 
                                    and through a giant prickly pear cactus forest, 
                                    search for pink flamingos, observe large colonies 
                                    of charming blue-footed boobies and snorkel 
                                    alongside tropical penguins. It is a dream 
                                    destination for nature lovers.<br>
                                    <br>
Our trip will begin with a flight to Quito, 
                                    Ecuador, for a three-night stay, which will 
                                    provide our group with an opportunity to explore 
                                    this city, known for its magnificent Spanish 
                                    colonial architecture, quaint family-owned 
                                    shops and lively open-air markets. On day 
                                    four, you will arrive on the small island 
                                    of Baltra, where you will embark the 88-passenger 
                                    M.V. Santa Cruz and have your first daily 
                                    briefing from the ship&#8217;s naturalists. 
                                    During the next five days, zodiacs will take 
                                    you ashore at Santa Cruz, Bartolom&eacute;, 
                                    Santiago, Rabida and North Seymour so that 
                                    you may explore these fascinating islands. 
                                    Your last night will be spent in Guayaquil, 
                                    Ecuador, before returning home.<br>

This 17-day cruise and tour of northeast Asia 
                                    begins in Hong Kong, where the culture blends 
                                    Chinese traditions and British influence. 
                                    After two days in this dynamic city, we continue

                                    years. You will disembark the ship in Tianjin,

Copper Canyon is a group of distinct canyons 
                                    in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. It is narrower, 
                                    deeper, more verdant and four times larger 
                                    in total area than the Grand Canyon. Our trip

The Tarahumara Indians are indigenous to northern

                                    in caves, under cliffs, and in small wood 
                                    and stone cabins in remote areas and lead 
                                    a simple life, undisturbed by modern technologies.

Campus Abroad trips have become a mainstay 
                                    of our travel program. Our travelers enjoy 
                                    them because they are shorter trips that concentrate 
                                    on one or two geographic regions and provide 
                                    an educational component. Our first Campus

                                    you will stay at the legendary Hotel Schweizerhof, 
                                    built in 1896. This cosmopolitan lakeside 
                                    resort is billed as the &#8220;top of the 
                                    world,&#8221; and you will have an opportunity

                  </em>Five years after our first visit to 
                                      the Great Lakes region, we invite Rice alumni 
                                      to return again to this countryside that 
                                      is virtually as untouched as it was hundreds 
                                      of years ago.<br>
                                      <br>
Three centuries ago, hunters and trappers 
                                      discovered the wealth of the Great Lakes.&nbsp; 
                                      One and a half centuries ago, miners gleaned 
                                      the hills here.&nbsp; From 1900 to 1950, 
                                      the Great Lakes were the premier vacation 
                                      spot for Americans who flocked to these 
                                      shores to witness the magnificent natural 
                                      beauty of the region.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
                                      so close to home that it&rsquo;s often overlooked 
                                      in favor of more far-flung destinations, 
                                      yet this region possesses a number of natural 
                                      treasures that rival or surpass those found 
                                      in more distant lands.&nbsp; The five interlocking 
                                      Great Lakes &ndash; Superior, Michigan, 
                                      Huron, Erie, and Ontario &ndash; measure 
                                      over 94,000 square miles and contain one-fifth 
                                      of the world&rsquo;s fresh water.&nbsp; 
                                      Today they continue to be a treasured resource 
                                      shared between two nations &ndash; a vital
