Brigance, a 1992 graduate in  Managerial Studies, received a number of Rice and Southwest Conference  recognitions for his collegiate football career.&nbsp; Off the field at Rice,  Brigance served as team liaison to the Career Services Office and inspired many  football players to consider how they would be better prepared for life after  Rice.&nbsp; His gridiron career spanned two professional leagues, four  professional teams, and nearly 10 years.&nbsp; He is one of very few players to  have won both Canadian Football League and National Football League  Championships and the only player to have done so in the same city:  Baltimore.&nbsp; In 2004, Brigance made the transition to an NFL front office  as he assumed the position of Director of Player Development for the Baltimore  Ravens.&nbsp; In that position, he developed programs to assist players in  positioning themselves to have robust careers on and off the field of play,  including player internship and continuing education programs.&nbsp; The NFL  honored Brigance with the Best Overall Player Development Program Award in 2005  and 2006, the Most Outstanding Internship Program Award in 2005, and the  Outstanding Continuing Education Program Award in 2007.&nbsp; That same year,  2007, Brigance was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s Disease, a  progressive neurodegenerative disease that currently has no cure.&nbsp; He  chose to make the best of his diagnosis and has since founded the Brigance  Brigade Foundation and partners with the Johns Hopkins Center&nbsp;for ALS  Research, becoming their ALS Ambassador.&nbsp; Richard W. Cass, president of  the Baltimore Ravens, said, &ldquo;It is difficult for me to imagine a better role  model for current Rice students than O.J. Brigance.&nbsp; He has had an  outstanding career, but to achieve that success he has had to overcome adversity  every step of the way. &nbsp;I am confident  that he would be an inspiration to Rice&rsquo;s current students, in much the same  way he is an inspiration to all of us at the Ravens and in Baltimore.&rdquo;</p>                              <p align="left">&nbsp;</p></TD>

One of his nominators wrote, &ldquo;As  a practitioner, an educator, a writer, and an ambassador of Rice, Charles  consistently pushes architecture&rsquo;s boundaries in unforeseen directions.&rdquo;</p></TD>

                                    <TD class="mainSmall" width="100%"><p>Dr. Ed Williams is Henry Gardiner Symonds Professor at  Rice University and the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business (JGSB).&nbsp; Since he joined the Rice faculty in 1978, he  has made extensive contributions to the university and added immeasurably to  the prestige of the JGSB and Rice as a whole.&nbsp;  The Jones School Entrepreneurship Program was initiated by Williams when  there were few such programs established in business schools within the United  States.&nbsp; In 2010, the Entrepreneurship  Program was recognized as the 6th best graduate school level program  of its kind, and the highest in Texas, as determined by the Princeton  Review.&nbsp; Williams has received the  Teaching Excellence Award from JGSB students seven times and finally asked that  he not be considered for the award going forward.&nbsp; One year, his student evaluations were  recognized as the highest throughout the university, not just within the Jones  School.&nbsp; His work to improve the  reputation and class programming at JGSB remains an important part of his  focus.&nbsp; He has participated on numerous  committees, including the Entrepreneurship Enhancement Committee, and in  several programs, including the Jones Graduate School Entrepreneur  Organization, where he works on creating alliances between the Entrepreneur  Organization and the Jones School by bringing Houston-area entrepreneurs  together with Jones students.&nbsp; Williams  was also the driving force behind the beginnings of Rice&rsquo;s Business Plan  Competition, which has evolved into the leading business plan competition for  graduate schools in the world.&nbsp; It offers  the largest pool of candidates and the richest opportunities for rewards and  financing.&nbsp;&nbsp; As one of his former  students, Gretchen Penny wrote, &ldquo;I believe that Ed Williams exemplifies someone  who is a tireless ambassador and emissary on Rice&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp; He has demonstrated a commitment to the  lifelong vitality of Rice University and the entrepreneurship program at the  Jones Graduate School of Business, in particular&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reputation of the Jones Graduate School  of Business, and of Rice University, would not be the same without the benefit  of having Williams as a part of the institution.</p>
