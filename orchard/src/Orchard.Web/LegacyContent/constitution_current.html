                        <p> Section 4. <em>Number of Nominees</em> - Unless otherwise directed by the Board, the Standing Committee on Nominations shall nominate only one candidate for each open Board position at each election. </p>

                        <p> Section 1. By a resolution of the Board of Trustees of Rice University dated July 19, 1968, the Board of Governors was enlarged by four alumni members to be termed Alumni-Governors. The terms of these Alumni-Governors are to run four years beginning July 1 following their selection and approval by the Board and the Board of Governors. </p>
                        <p> Section 2. The Board shall present to the Board of Governors a candidate along with three ranked alternates selected from a list of candidates put before the Board by the Standing Committee on Nominations.

The Board will then officially elect the selected candidate. </p>
                        <p> Section 3. The Standing Committee will consider the following as their guidelines in the selection of the nominees for Alumni-Governor(s): </p>
                        <p> (a) The nominee(s) should be a participating alumnus or alumna of Rice University whose year of graduation or, for non-graduates, the year when they would have graduated, is at least five years prior to the July 1 on which they would take office. </p>
                        <p> (b) The Committee should nominate those individuals who have a profound interest in higher education and a particular interest in Rice University. Success in chosen career or civic achievements are important but these should be secondary to an interest in higher education. </p>
                        <p> (c) Nominees for the position of Alumni-Governor should be individuals who can envision what Rice University, at its very best, could be. </p>
                        <p> (d) Committee assignment among the Alumni-Governors will be made by the Board of Governors. </p>
                        <p> (e) There should always be one Alumni-Governor on the Board who is a non-resident of the State of Texas. There should always be three Alumni-Governors who are residents of the State of Texas. Preferably, two of these latter three should be from the metropolitan Houston area. </p>
                        <p> (f) No alumnus or alumna of Rice University who receives a salary or other compensation from Rice University as a full or part-time employee or otherwise shall be eligible for nomination or election as an Alumni-Governor. </p>
                        <p> Section 4. Upon the death or resignation of an Alumni-Governor the vacancy shall be filled by the same nominating procedure as is used to fill the annual vacancy. The persons nominated for the vacancy shall satisfy the same requirements as their predecessor. The term of office of members so elected shall begin on the date of their election and shall extend through the unexpired term of the predecessor. </p>
                        <p> Section 5. The Standing Committee on Nominations will submit the names of the candidates certified by its chairman to the Board for acceptance or rejection at the next regular meeting of the Board. </p>
                        <p> Section 6. The names of the candidate for Alumni-Governor and the three ranked alternates will be certified to the Board of Governors by the Executive Director of the Association no later than February 1st of each year. </p>
                        <p>Section 7. The duties and responsibilities of the Alumni-Governors shall be set by the Board of Trustees of Rice University. </p>
                        <p> Section 8. Alumni-Governors become ex-officio members of the Board and shall be advised of the meetings so that they may attend and be kept aware of the current thinking of the Board. Alumni-Governors may participate in the Board meetings but shall not have the right to vote upon matters submitted for action. </p>
