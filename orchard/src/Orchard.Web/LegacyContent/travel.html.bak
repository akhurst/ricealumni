                    <p>South America is a continent of contrasts. From rainforests to sophisticated cities, explore colonial history and modern local life along South America’s eastern seaboard. Highlights of this 10-night cruise from Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires include the 17th-century Portuguese town of Parati, the tropical wonderland of Ilhabela, the lively city and markets of Montevideo, and the beaches and nightlife of fabulous Punta del Este. Described by Darwin as “more magnificent than anything any European has
                    ever seen in his country of origin,” Rio de Janeiro is blessed with an idyllic setting.</p>
                    <p>With two overnights in Buenos Aires, you can sample fine Argentinean beef and malbec wines and tour distinctive historic neighborhoods and monuments. Don’t miss samba and tango performances or better yet, take a lesson. Traveling aboard the luxurious Azamara Quest, a 654-passenger ship, you’ll enjoy elegantly appointed, customized staterooms and suites, culinary masterpieces prepared by some of the world’s most accomplished chefs, and a service staff who will anticipate your every need. </p>
                    <p>Your voyage includes many amenities at no extra cost: beverages, including wine with lunch and dinner; specialty coffees and cappuccinos; crew gratuities; and 24-hour room service. A selection of optional shore excursions will also be available. </p>
