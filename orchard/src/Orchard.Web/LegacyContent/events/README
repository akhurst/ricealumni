The subdirectories in this directory are the home
directories for the various regional Alumni groups.

The directory, /home/cwis/www/alumni/events, is linked
to the directory, /home/alumni/events, so that the 
content stored in the subdirectories is available on
the web.

The reason that we do the link and not store these
directories directly under the cwis directory is that
.forward files do not work if any directory above
the home directory are group writable.  This format
assures that they are not.
