<P>Don't make your team lose by not playing!
Welcome to the RICE Alumni Online Beer Bike Race! This is our first effort
to take this unique event virtually to allow alumni from all over the
country to participate in the upcoming festivities. You can help your
college win a post-race party sponsored by the Association of Rice Alumni by
simply voting for your favorite team below!
<P>All you have to do is enter your email address and college affiliation below
to register one hit for that college. The more hits a college gets, the
better its standings will be relative to the other colleges. The winning
college will be announced on the alumni website on March 20, 2003.
